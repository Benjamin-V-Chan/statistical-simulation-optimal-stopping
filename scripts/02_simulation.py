# Import required libraries
# Define a function to simulate the stopping strategy
#   - Accept list of payoffs and stopping threshold (percentage of exploration)
#   - Simulate observing a percentage of values and record the maximum observed
#   - Choose the next value better than the maximum observed as the stopping point
#   - Return the chosen payoff and stopping index

# Define a function to save simulation results to a CSV file
#   - Accept file path and results data
#   - Write the results to the file

# Main execution (if run directly):
#   - Parse user inputs for input file path, stopping threshold, and output path
#   - Load payoff data from the input file
#   - Simulate the stopping strategy for the given threshold
#   - Save the results to the specified file
